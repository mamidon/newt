===== June 4 ===============
*support actual masks & swap font rendering to that
*support arrow keys & move text up/down one line at a time
implement text buffer & cursor
implement simple text input at cursor location
implement complex keyboard navigation (ctrl + arrow)
implement complex keyboard selection (shift + arrow)

-- then perhaps I can begin integrating newt-lang into host
-- in theory, I'll have what amounts to a plain text editing control
-- I'd prefer to port as much of the text editing logic into newt-lang (and host only redirects input, renders output)
-- I suspect I'll need to implement some layout primitives before I can implement a minimal equivalent of Notepad's menu bar
-- I'll also probably need to extend newt-lang with ??? features... prototypes? modules? lists? string manipulation functions? file read/write functions?
